<p>A <a href="/gots/node/5">new release</a> (1.0-beta2) of Guide on the Side&nbsp;is now available for downloading and installing. The release provides <a href="https://github.com/ualibraries/Guide-on-the-Side/blob/1.0-beta2/RELEASE.md">some improvements</a> to the GotS functionality, and because this release fixes a potentially problematic security issue in CakePHP we recommend that everyone that is running GotS install this new version. See the <a href="https://github.com/ualibraries/Guide-on-the-Side/blob/1.0-beta2/UPGRADE.md">upgrade notes</a> for more information, and feel free to ask questions on the Guide on the Side <a href="/gots/node/6">discussion list</a>.</p>
